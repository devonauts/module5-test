  The form includes fields for First Name, Last Name, Email, and Password, along with a checkbox for agreeing to terms.
- **Grid Layout:**  
  First Name and Last Name fields are positioned side-by-side using Bootstrap’s grid system.

  Email and Password fields use validation classes to ensure they are required.

  Two buttons are provided:
  - One is visible on all screen sizes.
